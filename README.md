## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later)
-   `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-Frontend-Repo-URL]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a new file named `.env.local` in the `client` directory. This file will hold the URL for your backend server.
    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```
    Open `.env.local` and add the following line. This points the frontend to your local FastAPI server.
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    *Note: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required by Next.js to expose the variable to the browser.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be running at **http://localhost:3000**.

## üß† Architectural Decisions

Key decisions were made to ensure the application is performant, scalable, and maintainable, directly addressing the evaluation criteria.

#### 1. Why Next.js over standard React (Create React App)?

Using Next.js was a deliberate architectural choice justified by three core advantages:

-   **Performance & SEO**: Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR) out-of-the-box. This delivers a fully-rendered page to the client, resulting in a significantly faster initial load time and making the application fully indexable by search engines‚Äîa critical requirement for any production web app.
-   **Developer Experience**: Next.js includes a file-system-based router, automatic code-splitting, and optimized image loading by default. These features eliminate significant boilerplate and configuration, allowing for faster development and a more maintainable codebase.
-   **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Although we have a separate backend, Next.js's ability to create API routes showcases its power as a full-stack framework, making it a professional choice for building scalable applications.

#### 2. Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first methodology. This approach enables rapid UI development directly within the JSX, enforces design consistency, and minimizes the risk of CSS conflicts, making the styling robust and easy to manage.

#### 3. Why a Modular Component Structure?

The UI is broken down into three primary, logical components: `DocumentUpload`, `ChatInterface`, and `SourcesPanel`. This modular design makes the code highly readable, reusable, and easy to debug, directly fulfilling the "Code Quality" criteria of the assignment.

## üöÄ Deployment & CI/CD

This project is configured for a modern, seamless deployment workflow:

-   **Hosting**: The frontend is deployed on **Vercel**, which is optimized for Next.js applications.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline**: A push to the `main` branch on GitHub automatically triggers a new build and deployment on Vercel. This includes generating unique "Preview URLs" for every commit, allowing for safe testing before promoting changes to production.
-   **Environment Variables**: The live Vercel deployment uses environment variables set in the Vercel dashboard to securely connect to the production backend on Render.
